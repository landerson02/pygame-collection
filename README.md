# simple-pygame-games

This repository contains a collection of Pygame games that I created several years ago.
I decided to create this repository to keep the games around and share them with others who may find them interesting or
useful.

## Requirements

- python 3 or newer
- pygame 2.2 or newer

## Shootout

Shootout is a fast paced shooting game that puts your aim and reflexes to the test. Earth is being invaded by alien UFOs
and you must defend our planet by slaying them. Your goal is to score as many points as possible in a limited amount of 
time.

### Controls
The controls of shootout are very straightforward
- Move the mouse to aim at the enemies
- Left-click to shoot

## LadyBugger

Ladybugger is a classic arcade-style game inspired by the popular game Frogger. In this game, you control a charming
ladybug as it navigates through a bustling and hazardous environment.

The objective of the game is to guide the ladybug safely across a busy street to reach its destination. However,
numerous obstacles stand in its way, requiring quick reflexes and precise maneuvering.

### Controls

- Arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move
- Move the ladybug in order to not be hit by a car

### Game Over and Score

Points are scored by the ladybug moving forward along the street. The higher the level, the more points are scored. Once
the player reaches the end, they begin at the start of a new road, but the cars are not moving faster. The player must
continue along as many roads as possible before being hit.

## Flappy Toucan

Flappy Toucan is an addictive and challenging arcade-style game inspired by the immensely popular game Flappy Bird.The
player must guide a colorful toucan through a series of obstacles in a vibrant and captivating world.

### Controls

Players control the toucan's flight by tapping or pressing the space key to make the bird flap its wings. Each flap
causes the toucan to fly up a bit. The player must master the timing and intensity of the flaps to keep the toucan in
the air and maneuver through narrow gaps.

### Game Over and Scoring

The game continues until the player collides with an obstacle, resulting in a game over. At that point, the player can
choose to restart the game and aim for a higher score.

The score is determined by the number of obstacles the player successfully passes.

## Sharkio

Sharkio is an underwater adventure game where players take on the role of a small fish and attempt to become the largest
predator in the ocean.

The player begins as a small fish, and you must navigate through the environment and feed on small worms until you begin
to grow. As you grow, you will be able to consume larger fish. Meanwhile, you must avoid large predators that are
attempting to eat you.

### Controls

The player is controlled using the mouse. Simply move the cursor and the fish will follow.

### Game Over and Scoring

The game continues until the player encounters a fish that is larger than them. Points are scored by eating other fish.
The larger the fish, the more points it is worth.
